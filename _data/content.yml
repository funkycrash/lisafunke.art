  Hi! My name is Lisa and I'm a french-german **2nd year animation student** at
  **Gobelins**.


  I'm interested in **2D animation** and **layout/ background design** though I enjoy exploring every aspect of the animation pipeline. I'm currently looking for an **internship in February *(19/02 - 01/03)* or during the summer**. 


  When I'm not drawing, I'm either planning my next backpacking trip or reading the cheesiest romance novels you could think of.


  Thanks for checking out my website :)
