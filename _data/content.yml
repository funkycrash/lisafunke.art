  Hi! My name is Lisa and I'm a french/german animation student at Gobelins.


  I'm currently interested in character design and background art though I enjoy exploring every aspect of the animation pipeline. When I'm not drawing, I bake huge amounts of cookies or read the cheesiest romance novels you could think of.


  Thanks for checking out my website :)
