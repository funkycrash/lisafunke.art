  Hi! My name is Lisa and I'm a french-german layout artist & animator graduated from Gobelins (2025).

  I'm interested in **2D animation** and **backgrounds/layout**. 

  When I'm not drawing, I'm either planning my next backpacking trip or reading the cheesiest romance novels you could think of.


  Thanks for checking out my website :)
