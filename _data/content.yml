  Hi! My name is Lisa and I'm a french-german 2nd year animation student at
  Gobelins.


  I'm interested in layout/ background design and 2D animation though I enjoy exploring every aspect of the animation pipeline. I'm currently looking for an internship in February or during the summer. 


  When I'm not drawing, I'm either planning my next backpacking trip or reading the cheesiest romance novels you could think of.


  Thanks for checking out my website :)
