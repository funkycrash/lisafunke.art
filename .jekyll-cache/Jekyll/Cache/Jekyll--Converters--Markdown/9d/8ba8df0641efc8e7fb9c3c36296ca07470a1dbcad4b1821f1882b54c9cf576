I"}<p>Hi! My name is Lisa and I’m a french/german animation student at Gobelins.</p>

<p>I’m currently interested in character design and background art though I enjoy exploring every aspect of the animation pipeline. When I’m not drawing, I bake huge amounts of cookies or read the cheesiest romance novels you could think of.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my website :)</p>
